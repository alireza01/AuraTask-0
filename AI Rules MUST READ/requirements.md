# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AuraTask (اورا تسک) is a comprehensive Persian-language todo list and peronoal task management and personal productivity application designed to gamify task completion through an "Aura Points" system. The application combines modern dashboard design with AI-powered task prioritization, multi-theme support, and social leaderboard features. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, and Prisma, AuraTask provides a responsive, accessible, and engaging experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The application features a sophisticated three-column desktop layout with colorful, card-based UI components, real-time statistics, calendar integration, and multiple theme options including a Matrix-inspired dark theme and a 3D bubble theme. Users can track their productivity through gamified metrics, compete on leaderboards, and receive AI-powered task recommendations.
